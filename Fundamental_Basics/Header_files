These have to be included for the compiler to be able to perform its duty effectively. In instances when they are left out, error messages are returned.
In computer programming, a header file is a file that allows programmers to separate certain elements of a program's source code into reusable files. Header files commonly contain forward declarations of classes, subroutines, variables, and other identifiers. Programmers who wish to declare standardized identifiers in more than one source file can place such identifiers in a single header file, which other code can then include whenever the header contents are required. This is to keep the interface in the header separate from the implementation. [1]

The C standard library and the C++ standard library traditionally declare their standard functions in header files.
